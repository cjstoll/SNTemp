##  HTML

## Description

Use the HTML widget to directly inject HMTL, text, lists, or content in general into a page.

Because the HTML widget can contain content of any kind, any example may just appear as regular text. For example, the HTML widget appears as a box of text on the 404 page.

## Enhance or Expand Features and Functionality

OOB Widgets are `READ ONLY` so you can benefit from future updates. Edit and extend a widget's functionality; you need to clone it first in order to take advantage of existing code.

View production documentation ['Clone a Widget'](https://docs.servicenow.com/search?q=Clone+a+Widget) to learn more.
